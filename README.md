# DeGruchy Core Plugin

This is my "core plugin" for DeGruchy.org, it implements things that I don't really have any other place for. Things like code tweaks, CSS, Shortcodes and more.

Generally, the `master` branch is pretty stable. Other branches may be available for testing or developing different features.

I wouldn't recommend implementing this on your site unless you make substantial tweaks to it to fit your infrastructure. Feel free to take ideas from it. I have borrowed ideas from others to implement here, so...
